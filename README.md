This repository consists of the following code snippets, scripts for security configuration, proof-of-concept projects associated with security architecture. 

## Secure Configuration Management Script:
A script that automates the process of configuring security settings on servers, network devices, and applications based on industry best practices and security standards.

## Secure Communication with TLS/SSL:
Code snippets demonstrating how to implement secure communication using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt data transmitted between client and server applications.

## Secure API Authentication and Authorization:
Code snippets showcasing how to implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for APIs, such as using OAuth or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to control access to resources.

## Secure Coding Practices:
Code examples illustrating secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Secure Cloud Configuration:
Proof-of-concept projects demonstrating secure cloud architecture and configuration, including best practices for AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud environments.

## Security Incident Response Automation:
Scripts that automate various aspects of security incident response, such as notifying stakeholders, collecting forensic data, or isolating affected systems.

## Security Log Monitoring and Analysis:
Code snippets for parsing and analyzing security logs to detect and respond to potential security incidents or suspicious activities.

## Privileged Access Management (PAM) Automation:
Scripts or projects that automate privileged access management tasks, such as rotating privileged account passwords or enforcing access controls.
